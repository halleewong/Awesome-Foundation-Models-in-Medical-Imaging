## Overview

Foundation models, large-scale pre-trained deep learning models adaptable to various tasks, have gained interest across deep learning applications. In the medical imaging field, they enable contextual reasoning, generalization, and prompt-based task adjustments. This survey provides an overview of foundation models in medical imaging, covering fundamental concepts, taxonomy based on training strategies, application domains, imaging modalities, and more. It highlights practical use cases, applications, future directions, and challenges, including interpretability, data management, computational needs, and contextual comprehension.
